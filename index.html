      Some know Him as Emmanuel, others call Him Bright Morning Star, to some, He is 'Son of david'.
      Still, others call Him Yehoshua. His birth was announced as that of the 'King of the Jews' 
      yet the same ones who confirmed His birth mocked Him in death
      using the same description, 'King of the Jews'. Word on the streets, He is now called 'Bros J'. 
      Many agree He is the Son of God. One can only imagine Him nodding in agreement
      and saying 'Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you... but my Father which is in heaven'.
      Prophet; Oh yes, He is a man assigned many titles. Some yet, rather believe Him to simply be a prophet.
      Collectively, many will agree on this. He is Jesus, The Christ. 'Jesus Christ' if you may. 
      Without arguements, He is Rabboni, Master, Lord of all, yet, Friend.
      Lowly, Humble, the wisdom of God, the Word of God manifested in flesh, conceived of the Holyspirit, Born of a virgin girl. 
      His birth, just as foretold centuries before.
      His sonship confirmed by God himself. Eye witnesses recorded to have heard a voice out of the skies
       'This is my beloved son in whom I am well pleased' 
      as the Holyspirit descended upon Him out of heaven like a dove.
      He called himself 'Son of Man'. Man, God: The son.
